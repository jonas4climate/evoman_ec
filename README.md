## A Comparison of CMA-ES vs. NEAT on the Evoman video game framework

CMA-ES is a low-maintenance evolutionary strategy that requires little to no fine-tuning to perform numerical optimization but takes in a fixed-size controller architecture. On the other hand, while NEAT is capable of adjusting this architecture to enable higher performance, its large parameter space creates new challenges. In this project, we compare performances of these two algorithms on the Evoman framework.

### Setup



Evoman is a video game playing framework to be used as a testbed for optimization algorithms. A demo can be found here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqaMjd1E4ZI
